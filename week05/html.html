In CSS, the ::first-line pseudo-element can only have an effect when attached to a block-like container such as a block box, inline-block, table-caption, or table-cell. In such a case, it refers to the first formatted line of that container.

The first formatted line of an element may occur inside a block-level descendant in the same flow (i.e., a block-level descendant that is not out-of-flow due to floating or positioning). For example, the first line of the DIV in is the first line of the P (assuming that both P and DIV are block-level).

The first line of a table-cell or inline-block cannot be the first formatted line of an ancestor element. Thus, the first formatted line of the DIV is not the line "Hello".
