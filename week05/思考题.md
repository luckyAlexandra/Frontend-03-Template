为什么 first-letter 可以设置 float 之类的，而 first-line 不行呢?

https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#first-line

> In CSS, the ::first-line pseudo-element can only have an effect when attached to a block-like container such as a block box, inline-block, table-caption, or table-cell. In such a case, it refers to the first formatted line of that container.

>The first formatted line of an element may occur inside a block-level descendant in the same flow (i.e., a block-level descendant that is not out-of-flow due to floating or positioning). For example, the first line of the DIV in <DIV><P>This line...</P></DIV> is the first line of the P (assuming that both P and DIV are block-level).
